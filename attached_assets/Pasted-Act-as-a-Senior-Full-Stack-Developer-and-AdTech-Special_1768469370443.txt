Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and AdTech Specialist.
I am providing you with my existing PWA codebase. I need you to implement a comprehensive Monetization, Administration, and "Daily Free Limit" logic.

Here is the precise Specification Document including my AdSense credentials and strict security rules.

### 1. Global Configuration (AdSense)
You must inject the following Google AdSense script into the `<head>` of the `index.html` (or main entry file):

```html
<script async src="[https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4856462370528155](https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4856462370528155)"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
2. Global Ad Layout (ALL PAGES)
Requirement: The Banner/Sidebar ads must appear on EVERY PAGE of the application (Home, Game, Settings, etc.), not just the game view.

Implementation Strategy:

Move the ad layout logic to the main App Wrapper or Layout Component (e.g., App.js or Layout.js) that wraps the Router.

Exception: Do NOT show ads on the /admin route.

Responsive Layout Logic (CSS Media Queries):

Condition: If user.is_premium === true, DO NOT render any ads.

Desktop (min-width: 768px):

Layout: [Left Ad Column] - [Page Content] - [Right Ad Column].

Use CSS Grid: grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 200px;

The side columns must be sticky/fixed so they stay visible while scrolling.

Mobile (max-width: 767px):

Layout: Standard column.

Insert a Sticky Footer Ad fixed to the bottom (position: fixed; bottom: 0; z-index: 999;).

Add padding-bottom to the main content container to prevent the UI from being hidden behind the ad.

3. Database & User Model Updates
A. Update User Schema:

Add is_premium (Boolean, default: false).

Keep passwords hashed.

Critical: Ensure the user "RotemD" exists in the DB.

4. Admin Dashboard & Strict Security (Protected Route: /admin)
SECURITY RULE: The /admin route and all backend API endpoints related to administration must be protected by a strict Hardcoded Username Check.

Logic: if (currentUser.username !== 'RotemD') return 403 Forbidden;

Case Sensitivity: The check must be exact. "rotemd" or "Rotemd" must be REJECTED. Only "RotemD" is allowed.

The Admin Interface:

Create a page /admin.

Search: Input field to filter users by username.

Table: Display columns: User ID, Username, Premium Status (True/False).

Actions:

Toggle Premium: A button/switch next to each user to grant/revoke Premium status.

Reset Password: A button to reset a specific user's password.

5. "First Game Free" & Interstitial Ad Logic
This applies ONLY when the user clicks "Start Game".

The Logic Flow:

User clicks "Start Game".

Check 1: Is user.is_premium?

YES -> startGame() immediately.

NO -> Proceed to Check 2.

Check 2 (Daily Limit):

Access localStorage. Look for last_played_date and daily_count.

Get current date (YYYY-MM-DD).

IF last_played_date != today:

Set daily_count = 1.

Update last_played_date = today.

Action: startGame() (Free game for the new day).

IF last_played_date == today:

IF daily_count == 0: (Edge case, treat as new day).

IF daily_count >= 1:

Action: Trigger Ad Overlay Modal.

Increment daily_count.

The Ad Overlay Modal:

Full-screen overlay.

Text: "Watch this ad to start your next game...".

Display an AdSense ad unit inside.

Simulate Ad Completion: Implement a "Close Ad" button that appears ONLY after a 5-second countdown timer.

On "Close" click -> startGame().

Summary of Tasks for you:
Modify HTML head.

Build Admin Backend/Frontend with "RotemD" security.

Implement Global Responsive Ad Layout (Sidebar/Footer) in the main App component.

Implement localStorage logic for the daily free game.
